kagetsu is developed on assignment from Skatteverket (the Swedish National Taxboard)
to measure uptime on network devices to ensure fulfillment of internal SLA (Service
Level Agreements).

The project is fully coded in PHP, Perl and MySQL.

The code has been developed and released as GPLv3, to ensure that other agencies or
the public could possibly benefit from it.

(kagetsu is a japanese measure word for month-long periods.)
